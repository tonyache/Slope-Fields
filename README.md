# Slope-Fields

This repository contains files with code in Python that one can run in order to represent
slope fields corresponding to differential equations. The differential equations are 

1)y'=y-3
2)y'=y(y-3)
3)y'=x/x

You can simply modify the code in this repository to draw direction fields of your preference. 
The  idea to think of a differential equation, for example y'=y(y-3) as a system of differential 
equations on (t,y) by simply putting

t'=1
y'=y(y-3)

So that we are now considering the integral curves or flow lines of the vector field (1,y(y-3)) in the plane.
